                                                An adaptive user interface requires identification of user requirements. Interface designers and engineers must understand
                                                end-user interaction with the system to improve user interface design. A combination

                                                of the HIS user interface. User needs and requirements must be identified to
                                                adapt the interface to users during data entry into the system. System designers
                                                must understand user interactions with the system to identify their needs and
                                                preferences. Without this, interface design cannot be adapted to users and users
                                                will not be comfortable using the system and eventually abandon its use.
